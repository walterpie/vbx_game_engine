This file contains what was done each day during the vbx game engine development.
So yeah guys software takes time.

Version 0.01

>> Basic prototyping platform layer 

* Days: 001 - 006 [DAYS: 6, HOURS: 10:20 hours spent programming v0.01]

Day 001:
    - Starting to work on the platform layer.
    - Initialized the display buffer for the window.
    * Programming session duration: 1:30 hrs

Day 002:
    - Cleaning up the display buffer implementation.
    - Clearing the screen and pixel drawing.
    - Basic rectangle drawing and line drawing.
    - Testing the line drawing with some triginometry.
    * Programming session duration: 2:20 hrs

Day 003:
    - Platform layer keyboard input and mouse input.
    - Seperating the platform independent code for the platform dependent.
    - Platform independent input.
    * Programming session duration: 2 hrs

Day 004:
    - QueryPerformaceCounter and _rdtsc()
    - Enforcing a video frame rate
    * Programming session duration: 1:30 hrs

Day 005: 
    - Dynamic code reloading(Man, this one is alway a fun one).
    * Programming session duration: 1 hrs

Day 006: 
    - Cleaning up the code.
    - Seperating the software render code into a vertexbyte_soft.cpp
    - vertexbyte_intrinsics.cpp for intrinsics
    - Implementing a routine to wrap pixels and coordinates "around" the screen.
    - Acessing keyboard button states is now easier.
    - Basic 2d vectors implemented.
    * Programming session duration: 2 hrs


Version 0.02:

>> Made some games: froggert, asteroids.
>> Some more software rendering routines.
>> Added some basic physics.
>> Game memory and game state.

* Days: 006 - ??? [DAYS: ?, HOURS: ??? hours spent programming v0.02]

Day 007: 
    - Made frogger with v0.01
    * Programming session duration: 4:00 hrs
